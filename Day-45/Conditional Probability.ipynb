    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. It is denoted by `P(A|B)`, which represents the probability of event `A` occurring given that event `B` has occurred.\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where `P(A and B)` is the probability of both events `A` and `B` occurring together, and `P(B)` is the probability of event `B` occurring.\n",
